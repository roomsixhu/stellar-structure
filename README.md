# stellar-structure
A Fortran program from Calculations of the Stellar Structure of so called "Degenerate" Stars Using an New Pressure Function.

We reconstructed the main program from 1977 of an article from the astrophysical institute at Garching. As source we had a slightly corrupted print (only the header  missed). We named it fortss.f here.

*Calculations of the stellar structure of so-called degenerate stars using a new pressure function:*

[The article](https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2227006)

shortly after discovery the of these stars the author calculated them with a new pressure function, based on the virial theorem and a new zero energy:

$$-E=\tfrac {1}{ 2} (2 \pi^2)^{\frac {1}{ 3}} e^2 n^{\frac {1} {3}} = E\_{Fermi} = \langle E_{kin}\rangle$$
